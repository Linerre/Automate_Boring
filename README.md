# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
This repo contains my code/notes when reading the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

The files now are arranged in a messy order but I'll re-order them later.

I would be greatly happy if you happen to find some of my code helpful to you, or better, you have some feedback for me.
